# Springboard-SEC-Unit-44.2-Redux-Exercises

Two React Redux exercises for Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track.  A Meme Generator and Todo App created using React and Redux Toolkit.  Exercise instructions below:

> React + Redux Exercises
> Part 1 - Meme Generator - Redux
> Your application should do the following:
>
> Allow for the creation of a meme with a top and bottom text
> Allow for the removal of memes
> Your memes should be stored in Redux
> Part 2 - React / Redux Todos
> Itâ€™s another throwback to your todo app! Instead of storing todos in React state, move them to Redux state.
>
> Your application should do the following:
>
> Allow for the creation of todos
> Allow for the deletion of todos
> Be thoughtful about which component(s) need to useSelector to get data from Redux state.
